# SimpleModal
A very simple modal to help me understand the different systems in Magento 2. Not for production use.

## Installation Guide
* Create the following directory structure `app/code/Oddyssey`
* Run `git clone git@github.com:joshfortyfour/SimpleModal.git` inside the Oddyssey folder
* Enable the module `php bin/magento module:enable Oddyssey_SimpleModal`
* Run setup `php bin/magento setup:upgrade`

## Usage

As of version 0.1.0 there is no interface for altering the modal. Working on that. Just getting familiar with the new Ui Components system. Version 0.2.0 will have the ability to add new modals, delete modals, etc.
